This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). 
It is meant to be a digital library to keep track of your books.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

When you land on the page, you can add a book by adding it's name, author, and a link to the remote image (search for an image in google, right click, then press "copy image address")
